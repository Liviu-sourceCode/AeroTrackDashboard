# Aero Track Dashboard

## Project Overview
**Aero Track Dashboard** is a flight data monitoring project for aircraft, developed using MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) technology. The project provides a simple and elegant user interface to visualize the speed, altitude, and direction of an aircraft in real time.

## Main Features
- **User Interface**: Intuitive interface for monitoring flight data.
- **MQTT Integration**: Connects to an MQTT broker to receive and send data.
- **Data Transmission Toggle**: Button to activate and deactivate the transmission of aircraft data.
- **Console Box**: Displays messages from the broker and any potential errors.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for developing the user interface.
- **MQTT Library**: Paho MQTT library for managing communication via the MQTT protocol.
- **Version Control**: GitHub for hosting and versioning the code.

## Learning Outcomes
This project was created to demonstrate the use of the MQTT protocol for monitoring flight data and to provide a simple user interface for visualizing this data. It offered practical experience in integrating MQTT for real-time data monitoring and creating a user-friendly interface.
